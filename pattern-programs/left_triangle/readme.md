The left triangle star pattern is a triangle with its perpendicular line on the left side.

`*`
`**`
`***`
`****`
`*****`
Following are the steps to create a left triangle star pattern in C++:

Set the size of your triangle.
Create a nested loop with 1 internal loop that will print stars in the row.
Use cout << "\n" to break the line at the end of the internal loop.
The internal loop will run the number of times as the external loop has run.
