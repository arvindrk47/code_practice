Geek is very fond of patterns. Once, his teacher gave him a  pattern to solve. He gave Geek an integer n and asked him to build a pattern.

Help Geek to build a pattern.

 

Example 1:

Input: 5

Output:

`1`

`1 2`

`1 2 3` 

`1 2 3 4` 

`1 2 3 4 5`


 

Your Task:

You don't need to input anything. Complete the function printTriangle() which takes  an integer n  as the input parameter and print the pattern.

Constraints:
